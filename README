Roundcube Plus Free Skins
=========================

Roundcube Plus free skins add a new look to the Roundcube program. They are simplified versions of their commercial
counterparts: they don't include the mobile support.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
- Roundcube: 1.3.x or 1.4.x

This skin will not work properly on earlier versions or unreleased beta versions of Roundcube.

INSTALLATION
------------
1. Copy the contents of the 'plugins' directory included in this package to the 'plugins' directory of your Roundcube
installation. Follow the instructions found in plugins/xskin/README for installing and configuring the xskin plugin.
As explained there, you'll need to edit the Roundcube config file to add 'xskin' to the plugins array and specify your
license key. There are no special steps needed to install xframework. It doesn't need to be added to the plugins array

IMPORTANT: If you already have a full version of any Roundcube Plus skins, do not overwrite the xskin plugin as it will
cause errors when using your existing skins.

2. Copy the contents of the 'skins' directory included in this package to the 'skins' directory of your Roundcube
installation.

3. If you'd like to use litecube-f on the Roundcube login screen and as the default skin for the newly created user
accounts, edit the file [roundcube]/config/config.inc.php, find the line that begins with $config['skin'] and set it to
'<skin>'. If this line doesn't exist, add it at the end of the file,
like this:

$config['skin'] = 'litecube-f';
