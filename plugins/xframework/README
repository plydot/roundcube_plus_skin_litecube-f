ROUNDCUBE PLUS FRAMEWORK PLUGIN
===============================

This plugin provides a common framework for all the Roundcube Plus plugins.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
- Roundcube: 1.3.x or 1.4.x
- PHP: 5.6 or higher
- PHP Extensions: bcmath (for Geo IP to country functions)

INSTALLATION
------------
This plugin does not need to be installed. It simply needs to be present in the <roundcube>/plugins directory.
Don't add this plugin to the plugins array in the Roundcube config file.

COMPATIBILITY
-------------
This plugin has been created for the standard version of Roundcube as provided on the Roundcube website:
https://roundcube.net. It might not work properly with customized versions of Roundcube including the version
provided as part of the Kolab system. Please note that we cannot provide any technical support for the plugin
deployed on a non-standard version of Roundcube.

CONFIGURATION
-------------
This plugin does not have its own configuration file. But it offers some configuration options that can be added to
the main Roundcube config file: <roundcube>/config/config.inc.php.

**** LICENSE KEY (REQUIRED)

This option is required for the plugins and skins to function. The license key can be obtained from the customer area
of the website where you purchased the skins or plugins. Add the license key to the config file this way:

$config['license_key'] = 'your_license_key';

**** SHOW/HIDE SIDEBAR

Some Roundcube Plus plugins (for example, xcalendar, xlast_login, xnews_feed) add content to the sidebar that appears on
the left side of the screen. The sidebar will be visible by default; if you want to change this behavior and hide the
sidebar to begin with, add this to the config file:

$config['xsidebar_visible'] = false;

**** COLLAPSE/EXPAND SIDEBAR ITEMS

By default, all the items in the sidebar are expanded. If you want to change this default and collapse some items
to begin with, use this config option:

$config['xsidebar_collapsed'] = array('xcalendar', 'xquote');

In the example above, the items added by the calendar and the quote plugins will be collapsed while all the other items
will be expanded.

**** REORDER SIDEBAR

The items are added to the sidebar following the order in which the plugins are added to the plugins array. If you want
to change the default order of the sidebar items, change the order of the plugins in the plugins array.

**** ADD TO APPS MENU

Using this setting you can add your own, personlized items to the Apps menu. The items should be in the format:

url => array(title, image)

For example:

$config['add_to_apps_menu'] = array(
    "?_task=your_plugin" => array("title" => "Your plugin", "image" => "http://path_to_image.png"),
);

**** REMOVE FROM APPS MENU

Using this setting you can remove items from the Apps menu. Reference the items by their url, for example:

$config['remove_from_apps_menu'] = array(
    '?_task=settings&_action=preferences&_section=xcalendar',
);

**** DISABLE APPS MENU

If you'd like to remove the Apps button from the Roundcube header menu, use this setting:

$config['disable_apps_menu'] = true;

**** REMOVE VENDOR BRANDING

If you'd like to remove the Roundcube Plus branding from the login screen, add this to the config file:

$config['remove_vendor_branding'] = true;

**** CHANGE $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']

If the user IP on your server is not stored under $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'], you can use this setting to tell the
xframework plugin which $_SERVER variable to retrieve it from. For example:

$config['remote_addr_key'] = 'HTTP_CLIENT_IP';

In this case, the plugin will retrieve the user IP from $_SERVER['HTTP_CLIENT_IP'].

The user IP is used by some plugins that rely on xframework, for example xlast_login.

**** OVERWRITE ROUNDCUBE URL

The Roundcube Plus plugins use the variables from the $_SERVER array to construct the URL through which Roundcube can be
accessed. In some cases, the $_SERVER variables don't provide the right values and the constructed URL is incorrect.
If this is true in your case, you can bypass the xframework functions that construct the URL from the $_SERVER variables
and specify the Roundcube URL directly using this setting:

$config['overwrite_roundcube_url'] = "https://my-roundcube-is-here.com";
